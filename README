I need to add:

- Automatic figuring out of required status (adding required: false to field yml) by comparing the merged fields and if one is missing, then we're presuming it's required
- Fixes to nested fields so they work the same way too
- Extensive testing to make sure all fields are mapped and it works perfectly.

I've used 11ty to create the demo:

- Clone repo
- Run npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
- Run npx decap-server to enable local testing
- Visit http://localhost:8080/admin/ to test
