## Decap Spider

I need to add:

- Automatic figuring out of required status (adding required: false to field yml) by comparing the merged fields and if one is missing, then we're presuming it's not required
- Fixes to nested fields so they work the same way too
- Extensive testing to make sure all fields are mapped and it works perfectly.

The end result should be a CMS that is automatically generated based from page data, with correct nested fields and required status.

I've used 11ty to create the demo:

- Clone repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`
- Run `npx decap-server` to enable local testing
- Visit http://localhost:8080/admin/ to test

I want to be able to run `node run` to update the `src/admin/config.yml` file automatically.
